/**
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model. The system
 * distinguishes between 'student' and 'admin' roles. The primary administrator is
 * identified by the email 'naveenatariya999@gmail.com'. All study materials are
 * publicly readable by anyone to ensure easy access. However, all write
 * operations (creating, editing, deleting) are strictly reserved for the designated admin.
 * User profiles are private and only accessible by their owners.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized into three top-level collections:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user profile information.
 * - /admins/{adminId}: An allow-list of user UIDs that have admin privileges. This
 *   collection is not currently used by the rules for write access but is kept
 *   for potential future server-side management.
 * - /study_materials/{studyMaterialId}: Contains all public study content.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read, Admin Write: Study materials are globally readable, but write
 *   access is locked down to a specific admin email.
 * - Email-Based Admin-Check: Instead of managing an '/admins' collection from the client,
 *   the `isAdmin()` function securely verifies that the logged-in user's email is
 *   'naveenatariya999@gmail.com'. This is a robust method for a single-admin app.
 * - Strict User Data Privacy: A user's document in the /users collection can only
 *   be accessed or modified by that specific user. User listing is disabled.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * To ensure fast and secure authorization for updates and deletes, the `adminId`
 * (the UID of the admin who created the content) is denormalized directly onto each
 * document in the `/study_materials` collection. This allows rules to instantly
 * verify ownership (`request.auth.uid == resource.data.adminId`) without needing
 * slow and costly `get()` calls.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * This ruleset uses a single public `/study_materials` collection governed by
 * roles rather than separating content into different collections. This is suitable
 * because all study material is intended to be public, and the authorization logic
 * is based on the user's role (admin) rather than the content's state.
